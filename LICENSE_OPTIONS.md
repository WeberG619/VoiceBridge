# VoiceBridge Licensing Strategy

## üîí Dual Licensing Approach (Recommended)

### Option 1: Proprietary + Open Core Model
- **Core functionality**: Keep closed source (your competitive advantage)
- **Utility components**: Open source under permissive license
- **Commercial use**: Requires paid license from you
- **Personal use**: Free

### Option 2: Copyleft License (GPL v3)
- **Anyone can use**: For non-commercial purposes
- **Commercial derivatives**: Must also be GPL (protects your business)
- **Modifications**: Must be shared back to community
- **Your advantage**: You can dual-license for commercial use

### Option 3: Permissive with Commercial Clause
- **MIT/Apache style**: But with commercial restriction
- **Personal/Educational**: Free use
- **Commercial use**: Requires paid license from you

## üí∞ Monetization Protection Strategies

### 1. Trademark Protection
- **Register "VoiceBridge"** as trademark ($225-$400)
- **Prevents competitors** from using your brand
- **Protects app store presence** and marketing

### 2. App Store Control

- **Support contracts** and training
- **White-label licensing** for businesses

### 4. Freemium Model
- **Basic app**: Free on stores
