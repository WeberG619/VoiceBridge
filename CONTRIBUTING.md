   name: "Descriptive Skill Name"
   description: "Clear description of what this skill does"
   version: "1.0"
   category: "government|healthcare|employment|financial|education"
   ```

3. **Validate your skill**:
   ```bash
   ./tools/validate-skills.sh path/to/your-skill.yaml
   ```

4. **Test thoroughly**:
   - Test with voice input
