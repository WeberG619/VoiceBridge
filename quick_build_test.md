# Quick Build Test

## ✅ Fixed Issues:
1. **Removed Compose functions** from OnboardingActivity.kt (lines 482-803)
2. **Fixed BuildConfig reference** in OfflineCrashReporter.kt

## 🏗️ To Test Build:

**In PowerShell (not WSL):**
```powershell
cd D:\013-VoiceBridge\android
.\gradlew.bat clean
.\gradlew.bat assembleRelease
```

## 📱 Expected Result:
- Build should complete successfully
- APK created at: `app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk`

## 🔧 If Still Errors:
The main remaining issues would likely be:
- Missing Compose dependencies (remove more Compose code)
- Other BuildConfig references
- Import statement conflicts

## 📦 After Successful Build:
```powershell
# Create testing folder
mkdir testing_distribution

# Copy APK with friendly name
copy app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk testing_distribution\voicebridge-beta-test.apk
```

## 🚀 Then Upload to GitHub:
1. Go to GitHub releases page
2. Create new release: v1.0.0-beta.1-test
3. Upload: testing_distribution\voicebridge-beta-test.apk
4. Test on your phone!
