## Phase 1: Google Play Console Setup

### 1.1 Create Developer Account

### 1.2 Account Verification

## Phase 2: App Signing Setup

### 2.1 Generate Upload Key
```bash
# Create keystore for app signing
keytool -genkey -v -keystore voicebridge-upload-key.keystore \
  -alias voicebridge -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

# Store securely - you'll need this for all future updates!
```

### 2.2 Configure Gradle Signing
Add to `android/app/build.gradle`:
```gradle
android {
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            storeFile file('../voicebridge-upload-key.keystore')
            storePassword 'YOUR_STORE_PASSWORD'
            keyAlias 'voicebridge'
            keyPassword 'YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD'
        }
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
            minifyEnabled true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
}
```

### 2.3 Build Signed App Bundle
